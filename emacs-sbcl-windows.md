# Prepare the environment in Windows for configuring the portaclish Emacs IDE

Windows is designed to feel simple for end-users, but this often makes it clumsy
when you want to use it in a Unix/Linux-like way.
To ensure a smooth connection between Emacs and SBCL, we need to do a bit of
setup first. 

This guide is written with beginners in mind. Some explanations may feel overly
detailed if you are experienced â€” but the extra clarity helps avoid common
pitfalls. 

## 1. Installing Emacs, starting it for the first time, and adding a subdirectory

> **Note on prompts:**
> In this guide, lines starting with ```>``` show the Windows command prompt.
> Lines starting with ```*``` show the SBCL prompt.
> Do not type the prompt symbol itself -- only what follows it.
> (However, I will mention it again at the respective positions.)

1. We either visit a 
   [GNU Emacs FTP Mirror nearby](http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/windows) 
   -- which is recommended. Or, if no mirror is available for a longer time, we
   go to the 
   [main FTP server](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/) 
   -- which often is slower.
2. On the FTP server, we may choose the subdirectory of the newest *Emacs*
   version:
   
![Emacs newest directory](images/Emacs-newest-directory.png)

3. Within that directory, we may download the newest install file:

![Emacs newest exe](images/Emacs-newest-exe.png)

After executing that file, *Emacs* will be installed into 
```C:\Program Files\Emacs\emacs-30.2\bin``` (look for the ```emacs-xx.x``` that fits in
   your case). 
   
4. **Navigate to that directory** with the file explorer, and click the **file**
   ```emacs``` with the **right** mouse button.  Choose "pin to the taskbar",
   and a starter icon is added to the very taskbar.
   
5. Now, start *Emacs* for the first time.

6. Close *Emacs* again (just click the *Emacs* window's close button in the
   upper right corner, right now).
   
> **Notice:** By starting *Emacs* for the first time, the configuration
> directory ```.emacs.d``` is created.

7. We press the so-called "Windows" key. Now, we enter ```cmd``` for the
   *command prompt* -- also called *shell*, or *console*, or *terminal*.
   And then we click on the symbol that appears.
   
![cmd call](images/cmd.png)
   
8. The opened shell window should give us a prompt in *our* ```Users``` directory:

```
C:\Users\YourUserName>
```

After the ```>``` we enter our commands. That's why from now on I will indicate the
prompt with:

```
>
```

**And we enter only the things that *follow* this prompt sign.**

9. At that **command prompt** we *change directory* (cd) by entering this (press
   the ```Return``` after you input the line):

```
>cd AppData\Roaming
```

> **Notice:** Again, **do not** enter the ```>```.

10. Now, enter this command line at the prompt:

```
>mkdir .emacs.d\slime-contribs
```

> **Notice:** ```mkdir``` means "make directory". We just generated the
> subdirectory ```slime-contribs```

## 2. Installing Git

We proceed with downloading [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).  This will
be installed into: ```C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Programs```
   
## 3. Install Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) and localise it

1. It's time to install the ```.msi``` file of the latest sbcl version we
   [downloaded from here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbcl/files/sbcl). 
   This will extract the relevant files in 
   ```C:\Program Files\Steel Bank Common Lisp```. 
2. Path names with spaces make troubles in our *Emacs* configuration.  That's why we
   **make a copy** of this directory in our ```Users``` directory.
   To achieve this, we open the file explorer and let us display hidden files
   and directories first.  Therefore, we click the ```View``` tab and check the
   ```Hidden items``` box.
   
![Hidden items](images/view-hidden-items.png)
   
3. In the file explorer, we now see in our ```C:\Users\YourUserName\```
   directory the hidden directory ```AppData```.  (Please  look for *your* user
   name at your computer instead of the dummy ```YourUserName``` used here as a
   place holder.) 
4. Now, we navigate into the subdirectory
   ```C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Programs```, that already contains ```Git```. 
   
![Git](images/sbcl-local-programs-git.png)
   
5. By pressing ```Ctrl```+```n``` (or in Emacs notation: ```C-n```), we open a new
   file explorer window. There, we navigate to ```C:\Program Files\Steel Bank
   Common Lisp```. And we *copy* that *directory* with ```Ctrl```+```c```
   (i.e. ```C-c```).
   
![SBCL-global](images/sbcl-global.png)
   
6. We click into our first file explorer window with
   ```C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Programs```, and insert the copy
   with ```Ctrl```+```v``` (i.e. ```C-v```).
7. We *rename* this subdirectory from ```Steel Bank Common Lisp``` to something like 
   ```sbcl-2.x``` (according to the downloaded version of SBCL).

![Git-SBCL](images/sbcl-local-programs-git-sbcl.png)

## 4. Start the local SBCL from the *Emacs home directory*

1. In the current directory we enter:

```
>..\Local\Programs\sbcl-2.x\sbcl
```

> **Notice:** 
> * Replace ```sbcl-2.x``` with the local sbcl directory name you chose
>   above.
> * Calling the local ```sbcl``` like this works, because we can use the
>   *relative* path from the current directory.  With ```..\``` we tell the
>   shell to move one directory up, from ```Roaming``` to ```AppData```. And
>   from there, ```sbcl``` is found in the other subdirectory ```Local```.
>   So, we do not need to call the *full* path to our local ```sbcl``` copy:
>   ```C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Programs\sbcl-2.x\sbcl```.
  
2. At the appearing prompt **of SBCL** we enter ```(quit)``` and leave SBCL
   again.
   
Our shell now will look quite similar to this:

![command-shell](images/sbcl-in-cmd.png)

## 4. Installing Quicklisp (also consider the [README.md](README.md))

1. We download the file
   [quicklisp.lisp](https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp) into
   ```C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming```. 

2. **In our shell**, we start SBCL again with an argument (mind the dots at the
   beginning and the ```--load``` option at the end):

```
>..\Local\Programs\sbcl-2.x\sbcl --load "quicklisp.lisp"
```

3. *At the SBCL prompt*, we enter (*after* the ```*```):

```
* (quicklisp-quickstart-install)
```

4. After the completed installation, we enter:

```
* (ql:quickload "quicklisp-slime-helper")
```

5. After this process is finished, we ensure *Quicklisp* to be permanently
   loaded with SBCL:
   
```
* (ql:add-to-init-file)
```

6. We quit SBCL again:

```
* (quit)
```

7. At the *command prompt*, we enter this line:

```
>move ..\..\quicklisp .
```

> **Notice:** ```..\..``` tells the shell to move two directories up in the tree
> to ```C:\Users\YourUserName```. The final ```.``` of that line indicates the
> *current* directory. So, this line ```moves``` the freshly generated directory
> ```quicklisp``` into ```AppData\Roaming```.

8. Now, we enter this at the *command prompt* (**mind all dots**):

```
>emacs ..\..\.sbclrc
```
   
*Emacs* opens for the second time and shows the original content of the
newly generated SBCL configuration file:

```

;;; The following lines added by ql:add-to-init-file:
#-quicklisp
(let ((quicklisp-init (merge-pathnames "quicklisp/setup.lisp"
                                       (user-homedir-pathname))))
  (when (probe-file quicklisp-init)
    (load quicklisp-init)))
```

We modify the pathname after ```merge-pathnames```, so that the whole expression
looks like this:

```

;;; The following lines added by ql:add-to-init-file:
#-quicklisp
(let ((quicklisp-init (merge-pathnames "AppData/Roaming/quicklisp/setup.lisp"
                                       (user-homedir-pathname))))
  (when (probe-file quicklisp-init)
    (load quicklisp-init)))
```

9. We *save* the file with **our very first *Emacs key chord***: First, push
    ```Ctrl```+```x```, then push ```Ctrl```+```s```. **In *Emacs* notation:**
    ```C-x C-s```. You can just hold ```Ctrl``` constantly, and push ```x``` and
    then ```s```.
    
    > **Notice:** If we enter the wrong key chord, we can just ```Quit```
    > our input with **our very second *Emacs key chord***: ```C-g```. 
    
10. With **our very third *Emacs key chord***, we close our editor again: 
    ```C-x C-c```.

## 6. Configuring *Emacs* by downloading the portaclish ```init.el```

1. We open the ```init.el-windows``` in
   the 
   [repository](https://github.com/Lispl-Wicht/Portaclish/blob/main/init.el-windows).
2. We click the download button, marked red below:

![download](images/init_el-windows-download.png)
3. We download that file into the *Emacs* configuration directory:

```
C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d
```

4. **At the command prompt** we load that file with:

   ```
   >emacs .emacs.d/init.el-windows
   ```
   
5. With **our very fourth *Emacs key chord*** ```C-s``` we invoke a *search* in
   the bottom line of *Emacs*, the *minibuffer*. There we see the prompt:
   
   ```I-search:```
   
   We enter: ```Replace YourUserName``` and move to the searched string.
   
5. We follow the instructions of the comments in lines 262--264:

   ```
   ;;;; ********************************************************************************
   ;;;; Replace YourUserName with *your* user name!!!
   ;;;; And replace 'sbcl-2.5' with the directory name *you* have chosen!!!
   ```
   
   which refer to the **two** paths in the following expression:
   
   ```
   '((sbcl ("c:/Users/yourUserName/AppData/local/Programs/sbcl-2.5/sbcl.exe"
            "--core"
            "c:/Users/yourUserName/AppData/local/Programs/sbcl-2.5/sbcl.core")))
   ```
   
   As we can see: *Emacs* handles ```/``` in windows pathnames as if they were
   ```\```.  So, in *Emacs* the Unix convention can be applied.  (If you insist
   in using backslashes, you need *to mask* them with an additional one: ```\\```.)
6. Now, we save the file with ```C-x C-s``` and exit again with ```C-x C-c```.
7. **Back at the command prompt**, we rename ```init.el-windows``` to
```init.el``` by entering this line:

   ```
   >ren .emacs.d/init.el-windows .emacs.d/init.el 
   ```

8. Ultimately, we start *Emacs* by clicking on its icon.

If everything works -- like it did in my case (after long hours of try, error and
search  in my personal Nemesis Windows) --
the result should look similar to this, after a while of downloading and configuring:

## Final Notes

What have we done?

* The configuration file ```.sbclrc``` is searched by SBCL in the user's
  directory ```C:\Users\YourUserName```.  This directory is the *return value*
  of the *Common Lisp* function ```(user-homedir-pathname)``` at startup.  So,
  this file needs to stay there. 
* *Emacs* instead treats ```C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming``` as Home. If
  we work in that environment, it is more convenient if Quicklisp is also in the
  *Emacs* Home dir. But the *Quicklisp* library is installed in
  ```C:\Users\YourUserName```.
* A simple solution is to ```move``` the ```quicklisp``` directory into the
  *Emacs* Home dir, and  modify ```.sbclrc``` correspondingly -- like we've did
  in the 4th section, step 7-9.
* If this turns out to be a less favourable decision in general, it easily can
  be modified: Just copy, or move the ```quicklisp``` subdirectory into the
  *Windows* Home dir, and modify the ```#-quicklisp```-entry in ```.sbclrc```
  correspondingly again. 
  
Ok, and why an additional local copy of SBCL, again?

* I did not find a way how to convince Emacs to handle pathnames that contain
  space characters in the ```init.el```.  The suggested ideas with masked
  backslashes did not work out.
* Finding the correct Windows path entries for SBCL needed quite an
  uncomfortable time of tinkering with several variations. I am glad, that this was
  mentioned at Stackoverflow or so in a comment. It is also a good model for
  adding further *Common Lisp* implementations on Windows. It is only important,
  that the pathnames are correctly modified to the own system (step 5 of the 6th
  section).
* But to use the subdirectory ```Local\Programs\sbcl-2.5``` has a big advantage
  anyway:  It is more convenient to change to that directory in the first place.
* To keep the global installation allows to start it also from the start menu,
  which also could become convenient, if Emacs later will be connected to that
  instance as well.
* *Git* by the way is not needed necessarily. But the ```init.el``` also uses
  the package ```Magit``` -- the *Emacs* interface to *Git*.  And so, besides
  the future convenience, the absence of *Git* would result in an unnecessary
  error message.  And it creates ```Local\Programs```, which is a good place for
  *Linux* like installations.
